# Info
This is a collection of open source assets I have made over the years of gamedev. This includes:

-Open Hand Poser

-Open Physics Rig

# Requirements
These all require eachother to work together, as they are naturally compatible and built along side eachother. They also require the SteamVR ASSET and Animation Rigging Package.

# General Questions
Q: Can you use OpenXR/Will there be OpenXR support?

A: Maybe someday, but that day is not today. Due to how unreliable OpenXR has been in my experience it will not be coming for a while.

Q: Can you use the Oculus Asset?

A: No. I hate that thing. It's confusing to use.

Q: Can you use Unity XR?

A: Maybe. I need more practice with the framework.

Q: What unity version? 

A: I personally used 2019.4.11f1 because I like the load times and layout.

Q: How can I work on these?

A: Fork the project and make some pull requests.

# Known Bugs
A list of known bugs:

-When getting close to the ground, the player stops floating.

-Climbing doesnt work.

-Jumping isnt implemented.

# Setup
The setup is really easy, as I am trying my hardest to avoid layers and there is only one tag.
